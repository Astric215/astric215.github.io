            The goal of this project was to develop a hero character that would fight against a player-controlled boss and learn from the player’s actions. We attempted to accomplish this by utilizing a shifting behavior tree. The behavior tree shifted based on the situation that the hero character was in. The priority of these individual actions would rise and fall based on a situation and the character would take the highest priority possible action. I was responsible for designing the initial behavior tree model. Additionally, I was responsible for programming the player character’s attacks and relaying information to the AI-controlled enemy about the player’s actions. The enemy would then consult its priorities based on this information and take the best action in response. This resulted in an enemy that could quickly analyze the player's actions and learn to dodge their attacks.
