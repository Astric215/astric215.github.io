            Growing Gardens is a collaborative card game about making a garden for a client. I created Growing Gardens by myself and as such managed every aspect about the card game. I designed the art for every card in Adobe Illustrator. The main focus I had was on the mechanics of the game and the synergy of each card. I organized playtesting sessions to collect data on how the game played and how players reacted to each card. I hosted the card game through Tabletopia for these playtests. After each of these sessions I used the collected data to iterate upon my design and make the mechanics and art better. One example of this iteration was the introduction of a mechanic to remove unneccesary resources from the board so players could rapidly reduce the amount of resources they had to match their goal.
