            Miss Ing is Missing is a game about sending AI-controlled spies into a party to collect information about a missing person. During development it was my responsibility to develop the infrastructure for the map and develop pathfinding for the AI characters. I started by setting up the map as a interconnected grid of tiles. These tiles were defined as passable or unpassable with only passable tiles developing links to their neighbors. Since I had set up these tiles with links to their neighbors, I could then use a graph search algorithm like BFS or A* to pathfind across the map. I started by implementing BFS for our minimum viable product and then moved on to developing A*. I also did the writing for the events that the AI characters encounter and programmed the stats system that the player uses to solve these encounters.
