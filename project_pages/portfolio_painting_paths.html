            Painting Paths is a puzzle game about redirecting a blob of paint to a target stone to open a portal. I worked on a team to create painting paths over the course of a couple of weeks. I was in charge of puzzle and level design. Each level required its own puzzle to open the portal to get to the next level. I designed three different puzzle layouts to create three levels of increasing difficulty. I layed out objects that the player could rotate that would change the direction of the paint. I also worked to iterate upon each version of the game until the puzzles were at the right difficulty. I worked with the rest of the team during our intitial planning phase to lay out the design of the game and create an initial prototype. Once the initial prototype was done I was free to plan the more difficult puzzles.
