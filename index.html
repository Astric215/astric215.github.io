         &emsp; My name is David Diaz and I am a student at University of California 
         Santa Cruz. I am part of the University of California Santa Cruz 
         Computer Science: Game Design major. I spend most of my time analyzing the ways we make 
         games and the themes games present. Games are becoming one of the most important cultural artifacts of
         the modern day and I love being a part of their evolution. <br><br>
         &emsp;I try to design games with focus given to accessibility 
         and I love seeing how any player can engage with a game regardless of who they are. I am especially interested in
         designing inclusive experiences that are fine tuned to be entertaining, balanced, and fair.<br><br>
         &emsp;I am currently working on freelance projects as well as working alongside other students as part of the UCSC Games Design and Art collaboration.
