         &emsp; I am a Technical Designer who focuses on communication and implementation of mechanics across 
         teams. I enjoy tackling the problem of how to get a design that feels good and then getting that design 
         implemented. I also love to see players engaging with that design and then taking any feedback to tweak 
         the design or implementation until it feels just right.
         <br><br><br>
         &emsp; I recently graduated from the University of California: Santa Cruz with a Computer
         Science: Game Design degree. This means that I have extensive experience working with the design and
          implementation of mechanics into any project I am working on. I am also well versed in working in teams
          and communicating the implementation of a game to non-programmer teammates. I work to 
          ensure that the mechanics of the project correctly convey the intended design and to improve cohesion 
          between the mechanics and the aesthetic of the game. 
          <br><br><br>
          &emsp; I am currently leading a team working on a a team-based cryptid game.
