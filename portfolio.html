               I managed every aspect about Growing Gardens. I designed the mechanics from the ground 
               up and designed each card. I also organized playtesting session to collect data on how the 
               game played. I used the collected data to iterate upon my design and make the mechanics and art better.
               One example of this iteration was my introduction of a mechanic to remove unneccesary resources from the board
               so players could rapidly reduce the amount of resources they had to match their goal.

            I developed Warp Speed as part of a minigame jam. All minigames were put together to create a minigame 
            collection. As part of this project I utilized Unity and C# to make the game fit alongside pre-existing 
            features of the minigame such as the timer. I also had to ensure that my minigame would mesh well with others 
            through the theme of Speed or Size.

            I worked on a team to create painting paths over the course of a couple of weeks. I was in charge of puzzle
            and level design. Each level required its own puzzle to open the portal to get to the next level. I also 
            worked to iterate upon each version of the game until the puzzles were at the right difficulty. I worked with 
            the rest of the team during our intitial planning phase to lay out the design of the game and create an initial 
            prototype.
